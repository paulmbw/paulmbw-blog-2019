For months I’ve been wanting to up my game and improve the look (and content of course) of my blog, and I’ve finally got around doing so. Anyway, back to the story…</p>\n<p><strong>The Idea… 💡</strong></p>\n<p>First of all, let’s begin with some context. Me and my co-founder and very good friend Charlie Dowler (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/charliedowler/\">@charliedowler</a> - that’s his instagram!) are aiming to shake the fitness industry through an immersive and easy-to-use app called Doit. Here is our elevator pitch:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You’re into running, lifting weights at the gym or yoga. What if there was a way where you can meet someone with the same fitness interests, levels and schedule in your area, and exercise with them?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, how’s our pitch?! That is essentially what we are trying to achieve, a simple way for people to meet other like-minded individuals who want to work out and keep fit, all whilst creating new relationships. We’ve been building the startup since August of this year, and it’s been an interesting and challenging few months. Along with this and upcoming posts, I envision documenting our journey and experience as we navigate through building what we believe is a valuable and life-changing product, mistakes we made along the way and the success we achieve (hopefully 😁).</p>\n<p><strong>Where are you now?</strong></p>\n<p>Glad you asked! We’ve just applied to a startup school called <a href=\"https://www.wearenova.co.uk\">We Are Nova</a>, but it’s very early stage. So far, we’ve been documenting a brief business plan outlining what we are building and defining our target audience. In terms of the app, we have a proof of concept that’s a work in progress. We opted for a cross-platform approach using React Native, and all of our backend technology is hosted on AWS, comprising of API Gateway, AWS Lambda Functions and DynamoDB.</p>\n<p><strong>Where will you be in 3-6 months time?</strong></p>\n<p>Great question. Depending on how we progress with the startup school, we aim to have a working MVP by March with an initial release by April. These are not hard deadlines (phew!) but it’s important to have a plan and a goal to achieve whatever project you’re building.</p>\n<p><strong>Why are you building a startup?</strong></p>\n<p>A few reasons to mention, the first including particular circumstances that lead me here. I was previously approached to help out on building a similar idea to the one mentioned before, and we spent a substantial amount of time trying to get the app running. However, a few months passed and our business relationship began to fragment, resulting in deciding to call it a day with the idea. It was a difficult time as we invested a lot of effort into it (evenings after work, meeting up on weekends etc.) which in hindsight could have been better spent elsewhere, but who said building a startup was a walk in the park? Anyway, fast forward a couple of months. I was fortunate to meet Charlie back in May who had just started a new role where I am currently working at <a href=\"https://www.mdsol.com/en\">Medidata</a> (btw, we are hiring! Contact me for more info!) and he was very on board with the idea once we got to know each other. Charlie has been and continues to be an absolute pleasure to work with. He’s contributed amazing ideas to the project and I can’t wait to see how far we go with Doit.</p>\n<p>Moreover, I personally don’t see myself working a full-time job forever! I mean, I love what I do, and becoming a software engineer had always been on my agenda from young. However, a part of me begs to question; what would it be like to build a startup? Why don’t I try and, well, see what happens? Without sounding too philosophical, life isn’t necessarily a straight line - school, work, retire. Life is about trying things and see how they go! I’m very hopeful and positive about what we have so far, and my excitement and enthusiasm is fueling my motivation thus far, so like I said before, let’s see what happens!</p>\n<p><strong>What have been your struggles so far?</strong></p>\n<p>I think the biggest struggle I’ve had personally is balancing my time between building this startup, maintaining friendships, exercising and having some downtime (I like to read - <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Knife-Never-Letting-Chaos-Walking/dp/1406320757\">The Knife of Never Letting Go</a> -  and play PUBG 😎). As we draw closer to 2019, finding time will continue to be a challenge and we have to stay on top of things in order to make this a success.</p>\n<p>Adding to this, motivation plays a big part in building a startup, and on some days I’ve lacked the urgency and drive to move this forward. This has often lead to doubts - is this startup a good idea? Will it work? Are people going to download this app and use it? These thoughts have played in my mind for some time, but giving up is never an option. </p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>Hopefully I’ve given you an insight into what’s involved with building a startup. We are very early stage so I appreciate you may find this blog lacking in detail, but I hope to delve more as we journey through this startup life. I hope you enjoyed the first post!</p>","fields":{"tagSlugs":["/tags/startuplife/","/tags/business-venture/"]},"frontmatter":{"title":"Startup Life 🏃🏾‍♂️","tags":["startuplife","business venture"],"date":"2018-12-27T23:46:37.121Z","description":"I'm building a startup.
