For months I’ve been wanting to up my game and improve the look (and content of course) of my blog, and I’ve finally got around doing so. Anyway, back to the story…</p>\n<p>First of all, let’s begin with some context. Me and my co-founder and very good friend Charlie Dowler (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/charliedowler/\">@charliedowler</a> - that’s his instagram!) are aiming to shake the fitness industry through an imersive and easy-to-use app called Doit. Here is our elevator pitch:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You’re into runnning, lifting weights at the gym or yoga. What if there was a way where you can meet someone with the same fitness interests, levels and schedule in your area, and exercise with them?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, how’s our pitch?! That is essentially what we are trying to acehive, a simple way for people to meet other lilke-minded individuals who want to work out and keep fit, all whilst creating relationships. We’ve been building the startup since August of this year, and it’s been an interesting and challening few months. Along with this and upcoming posts, I envision documenting our journey and experience as we navigate through building what we believe is a valualbe and life-chaging product, mistakes we made along the way and the success we achieve (hoepfully 😁).</p>\n<p><strong>Where are you now?</strong></p>\n<p>Glad you asked! We’ve just applied to a startup school called <a href=\"https://www.wearenova.co.uk\">We Are Nova</a>, but it’s very early stage. So far, we’ve been documenting a breif business plan outlining what we are building and defining our target audience. In terms of the app, we have a proof on conept that’s a work in progress. We opted for a cross-platform approach using React Native, and all of our backend technology is hosted on AWS. </p>\n<p><strong>Where will you be in 6 months time?</strong></p>\n<p>Great question. Depending on how we progress with the startup school, we aim to have a working MVP by Marchm with an initial release by April. These are not hard deadlines (phew!) but it’s important to have a plan and a goal to achieve whatever project you’re building.</p>\n<p><strong>Why are you building a startup?</strong></p>\n<p>A few reasons to mention, the first including particular circumstances that lead me here. I was previously approached to help out on building a similar idea to the one mentioned before, and we spent a substantial amount of time trying to get the app running. However, a few months passed and our business relationship began to fragment, resulting in deciding to call it a day with the idea. It was a difficult time as we invested a lot of effort into it (evenings after work, meeting up on weekends etc.) which in hindsight could have been better spent elsewhere, but who said building a startup was a walk in the park? Anyway, fast forward a couple of months. I was fortunate to meet Charlie back in May who had just started a new role where I am currently working at <a href=\"https://www.mdsol.com/en\">Medidata</a> (btw, we are hiring! Contact me for more info!) and he was very on board with the idea once we got to know each other. Charlie has been and continues to be an absolute pleasure to work with. He’s contribted amazing ideas to the project and I can’t wait to see how far we go with Doit.</p>\n<p>Moreover, I personally don’t see myself working a full-time job forever! I mean, I love what I do, and becoming a softwae engineer has alwasy been on my ageneda from young. However, a part of me begs to question; what would it be like to build a startup? Why don’t I try and, well, see what happens? </p>\n<p><strong>What have been your struggles so far?</strong></p>\n<p>I think the biggest struggle I’ve </p>\n<p> had is balancing my time between building this startup, maintaining friendships, exercising and having some downtime (I like to read and play PUBG 😎).</p>","fields":{"tagSlugs":["/tags/startuplife/"]},"frontmatter":{"title":"Startup Life 🏃🏾‍♂️","tags":["startuplife"],"date":"2018-12-27T23:46:37.121Z","description":"I'm building a startup.
