You can read it <a href=\"https://tjcx.me/posts/consumption-distraction/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>I’ve been in what it feels like a never ending battle against social media, wanting to leave platforms such as Facebook and Instagram alike, and not following through fearing I’d miss out on everything. I just can’t leave. And this is where the problem lies.</p>\n<p>Okay, let me provide some context. January 2018 was the month I decided I was done with Facebook and Twitter. Oh my, the first couple of months were horrendous. The urge to check my phone remained which, honestly, felt like some sort of drug addiction. During my commutes to work, or when conversations came to a natural pause, I’d immediately feel like checking my phone.</p>\n<p>I didn’t quit social media entirely because I still had Instagram (often accessed through my browser because I convinced myself I’d spend less time on it that way - ha), and my LinkedIn and YouTube accounts remained. I couldn’t get rid of the last two; my career depended on the former, and I used the latter to catch up on the latest album review from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnxQ8o9RpqxGF2oLHcCn9VQ\">fantano</a>.</p>\n<p>I ran into ‘Consume less, create more’ whilst travelling to Spain, and forthwith felt a responsibility to create more. I mean, I’m incredibly privileged to be where I am. We live in a generation where internet access is easily obtainable, and the arsenal of resources online is limitless. Why aren’t I creating enough? What’s my excuse? It would be disastrous to live my life constantly consuming, because that’s where comfort is. Pardon me, that may sound extreme, and frankly a tad hypocritical because I haven’t created enough myself. But I’m so glad I ran into this post. It was a bit of a wake up call.</p>\n<p>As a result of this discovery, I went and deleted the apps on my phone I felt were consuming my precious time. Away with LinkedIn, YouTube (this is going to be tough), and stopped using Instagram through my browser (my highest level of delusion - I still wasted time on it!). </p>\n<p>Deleting such apps plays only a small part of the whole solution. The issue I’m working to address is understanding where my time goes, and hopefully help you think about what you spend your time on. Instead of scrolling through new posts on Instagram or Twitter, perhaps you could write a poem? Or, write a blog post on your experience using social media? Or maybe even list a couple of app ideas that could solve a problem you’ve faced? Starting off is always the hard part. Writing and publishing my first blog post was a difficult experience due to lack of confidence and worrying no one would read it. Such hurdles are possible to overcome through trying it out and persevering. </p>\n<p>In a bid to challenge myself and to be held accountable, I’d like to set some realistic goals I can achieve:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>upload 3 blog posts a month </li>\n<li>Create 5 app ideas a month (no matter how crazy they sound)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To conclude. Everyone has something they can create. Be it in tech, finance, or English Literature, your domain needs more creators. It needs more ideas that can be scrutinised, improved, trashed and created all over again. Let us use the precious time we have and the valuable resources to consume less, and create more.</p>\n<p>A big thank you to @TJCX for publishing <a href=\"https://tjcx.me/posts/consumption-distraction/\">Consume less, create more</a>.</p>","fields":{"tagSlugs":["/tags/thoughts/"]},"frontmatter":{"title":"My response to 'Consume less, create more'","tags":["thoughts"],"date":"2019-07-31T00:00:00.121Z","description":"In a world with endless resources, we have a responsibility to create more.
