Hi there!

I'm Paul, I'm 23 and I describe myself as a curious, energetic, complex being navigating through this thing called life. I currently reside in London working as a software engineer for [Bulb](https://www.bulb.co.uk). For more information about what I do exactly, have a look at my [CV](./paulwawerucv.pdf).

That is a photo of me in Pula, Croatia (a wonderful city btw, you should visit!).

This blog is compirsed of my opinions and my opinions alone. I'll post stuff about tech, travelling, or random things that tickle my fancy. Feel free to read and share!

You can easily contact me via my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-waweru-35652594/) and view my projects on [Github](https://github.com/paulmbw).

If you're in the tech field looking for your next role (either software engeering, QA etc.), drop me a message on LinkedIn or feel free to [email](mailto:paul.waweru58@gmail.com) me.

That's all, enjoy! üëª
