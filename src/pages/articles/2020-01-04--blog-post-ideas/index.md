# Ideas

- Changing your mindset - how it helped me achieve my fitness goals
- Don't quit your job to build a startup; build a startup to quit your job 
- When a *good* idea makes a *good* business
- My startup journey

## My startup journey

- I was introduced to a friend who had a business idea to change the world of relocation. He wanted to make moving to a new city an easier process
- Your inital idea rarely ends up what you're building; expect pivoting several times in aim of identifying value for both you as a company and your customers
- Find a partnering founder; you cannot build a *successful* startup alone.
