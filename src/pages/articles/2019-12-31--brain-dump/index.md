_**4 min read**_

Honestly speaking, to a large extent I enjoy what I do. I am software engineer working for a growing green energy company, contributing to what I think are impactful and positive changes to society. I work with some of the smartest people I've ever met, who share the same passion and desire to make a change in this world. My commute is 40 mins max compared to my last gig which took me 1hr and 20 minutes to get to Hammersmtih, the pay is good, the list of positive things I could say about my job is long.

But why is this not enough?

Why aren't I content? Why am I not satisfied? A few questions I ask myself in search of an answer. I don't really know where I am getting at, but I guess it doens't matter as this is a brain dump. It's not meant to lead anywhere or form a comclusion.

The idea of conforming to what we're told from young age is the root of my *dissastisfaction*. Get good grades, get into a good university, graduate with a top degree, get a good job, get a mortgate. You've heard this story before and you know how it usually ends. 

There is nothing *wrong* with such a lifestyle. For some, stability is the goal which can be used to help support their own, and to live a normal life. That is a dream for some people, so no disrespect to them. I just have a niggling voice in my head telling me this life is not for me. The idea of spending 9 hours at work, 5 days of the week, with only a couple of hours (average 4 hours depending on your curfew) and the weekend to do the things you enjoy the most. Why does it have to be like this? Why should we be born into this automatic, repetitive lifestyle?

Being at home for the past couple of weeks has given me a stark reminder of how important my family are. The time spent together does not really compare with anything else. It was great completing a 1000 piece puzzle with my sister, cooking for the family, spending time away from work. It was great. And it's this repetitive lifestyle that robs us the time to do what is important.
