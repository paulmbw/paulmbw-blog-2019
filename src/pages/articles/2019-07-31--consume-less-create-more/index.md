This is my response to a post titled __Consume less, create more__, which delves into the issue of technology making us consumers instead of creates. You read it [here](https://tjcx.me/posts/consumption-distraction/).

I’ve been in what it feels like a never ending battle against social media, wanting to leave platforms such as Facebook and Instagram alike, and fearing I'd miss out on everything. I just can't leave. And this is where the problem lies.

Okay, let me provide some context. January 2018 was the month I decided I was done with Facebook and Twitter. Oh my, the first couple of months were horrendous. The urge to check my phone remained which, honestly, felt like some sort of drug addiction. During my commutes to work, or when converstaions came to a natural pause, I'd immediately feel like checking my phone.

I didn’t quit social media entirely because I still had Instagram (often accessed through my browser because I convinced myself I’d spend less time on it that way - ha), and my LinkedIn and YouTube accounts remained. I couldn’t get rid of the last two. My career depended on it firstly, and I needed to catch up on the latest album review from the needle drop. 

I ran into ‘Consume less, create more’ whilst travelling to Spain, and forthwith felt a responsibility to create more. I mean, I’m incredibly privileged to be where I am. We live in a generation where internet access is easily obtainable, and the arsenal of resources online is limitless. Why aren’t I creating enough? What’s my excuse? It would be disastrous to live my life constantly consuming, because that’s where the comfort is. Pardon me, that may sound extreme, and frankly a tad hypocritical because I haven’t created enough myself. But I’m so glad I ran into this post. It was a bit of a wake up call.

As a result of this discovery, I went and deleted the apps on my phone I felt was consuming my precious time. Away with LinkedIn, YouTube (this is going to be tough), and stopped using Instagram through my browser (my highest level of delusion - I still wasted time). 

Deleting such apps plays a small part of the whole solution. The issue I'm working to address is understanding where my time goes, and the things I'm spending my time on. Instead of scrolling through new posts on Instagram or Twitter, perhaps you could write a poem? Or, write a blog post on you're experience using social media? Or maybe even list 5 app ideas that could solve a problem you've faced? Yeah, they may be terrible at first. Writing my first blog post was a difficult experience, mainly becuase I was worried I wouldn't make any sense, or no one would be interested in reading it. Such hurdles are can be overcome only with perserverance.

In a bid to challenge myself and to be held accountable, I'd like to set some realsitic goals I can achieve:

- upload 3 blog posts a month 
- Create 10 app ideas a month (no matter how crazy they sound)

To conclude. Everyone has something they can create. Be it tech, finance, English Literature, your domain needs more creators. It needs more ideas that can be scrutinised, improved, trashed and created all over again. Let us use the precious time we have and the valuable resources to make a change.
