**Disclaimer alert:** I haven't left social media _entirely_. I do use YouTube and LinkedIn from time to time (mostly the former), and I have a very weird relationship with Instagram as I only access the app when I'm traveling abroad, or through my web browser (which surprisingly limits my use - more on this later).

## Pulling the Facebook/Twitter plug
As of December 2017, I officially pulled the plug on my Facebook account, with Twitter following suite 3 months later. Prior to this somewhat dramatic end came a lot of hesitation and denial:
- "what else will is there to do on my phone?!"
- "I'm not _that_ addicted to Facebook, what's the big deal?"
- "I need these platforms to keep in touch with family and friends..."
- "Your potential date needs to stalk you first before meeting you" 

This list of excuses go on. It definitely was a difficult time accepting the fact it was time to go, but for months I convinced myself it wasn't a serious issue at all, and I was probably overthinking the whole idea. It was only until my craving for refreshing the news feed became more apparent when I noticed this repetitive behaviour whilst spending time with family and friends, traveling, over lunch/dinner. It was definitely time to leave.

## The desire for an updated news feed
Apps such as Facebook and Twitter are addictive, and they're built for this. I often found myself always refreshing my screen to see the latests posts and tweets, which made me feel good. I felt as though I was up to date, I knew what was going on in regards to family and friends, the latest memes and and videos. It felt great! FOMO (or fear of missing out) played a huge role in using these social platforms, and I couldn't imagine a life without it

## Filling the void
The biggest challenge wasn't pressing the deactivate button on either of these platforms, it was what came after. During my commutes to and from work, right before sleeping, and more often during conversations when the topic drew to a natural conclusion, the first thing I'd do is check my news feed. It's during these occasions where I'd being the endless scrolling through data which, in hindsight, meant nothing at all. Even a year and half on from leaving social media, I do struggle with filling the void left from tweets and posts, but I've definitely become much better at finding at alternative.   

 the awkward silence during a conversation, the most natural and insticitive behaviour was to pull out my phone to see my updated news feed. All of those three events still take place, and this whole experience has taught me to find better use of my time. My daily commute is now comprised of reading
