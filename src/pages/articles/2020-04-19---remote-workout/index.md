You've probably heard what's going outside, and you've probably been impacted in one way or another. For myself, it's meant working remotely, not being able to go to chuch for prayers, but also notably not being able to exercise outside as I used to. Typically, this would consist of going to the gym or playing football with friends, which is no longer possible due to social distancing rules in place. It's a strange time for everyone as we've learned to adapt and find alternatives to our usual lifestyle.

On the topic of working out and exercising, my friend Kal and I experimented with working out online. Here, we document our expereince and what it was like, challenges we faced and a few ideas on what can be improved.

## The workout

I'm based in London, while Kal is based in Lagos, Nigeria. We followed a YouTube video titled [Cardiovascular Punishment Ver 2. 10 rounds. Military SMOKE ðŸ’¨ CHECK to keep you lean and fit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QqoSyqckqA&t=912s). Spoiler alert, we did not make it through the what seemed a gruelling 43 mintue workout. We did however do 15 minutes...better than nothing, right?!

We used Skype as a means of connecting with each other and had a seperate window with the workout video. It looked something like this:

## What was great 

What I most enjoyed about this experience was simply sharing it with someone else. I could have easily followed the workout tutorial on my own, but I knew it wouldn't have been the same. I would have lacked the voice to push me to do the last burpee, and to motivate me to keep going. Exercising really does make a difference when you're sharing with somomne else.

## What wasn't great

We had to jump over a few technical hurdles before getting started with the workout. I had initally got set up using an iPad and multitasking with Skype and YouTube. I later realised while being on the Skype call, the camera shuts off once you navigate to a different app, which I thought was quite dissapointing. As an alternative, I only used the tablet for the Skype call and used my laptop to follow the workout tutorial. 

Moreover, we also had to ensure we started the video at the same time to be in sync. Kal also had the video opened and we had to essentially click play simultaneously. This worked somehwhat well, but there were times where I had noticed I was a few seconds behind.

## What can be improved

Thinking ahead, working out online using Skype and YouTube could easily become a routine, and it'll also be great fun having more friends on the call. It would be a much smoother expereince if it were possible to have more people on the call (say around 5 or 6 friends), and for all of us to easily follow the workout tutorial. 

Furthermore, a big part of working out includes seeing how much you have improved over a period of time. It would be awesome to be able to track all of the workout tutorials you and your friends have watched, and also earn rewards for completing different workouts.

## Conclusion 

All in all, working out has always been a fun and enjoyable experience for myself. My friend Kal can also attest to that also. The pandemic, however, has forced people to think outside of the box in terms of how the workout, and also how they continue to live their life. I would highly recommend giving it a go. A note for us; perhaps start off with a beginner level workout and avoid any vidoes titled "cardiovascular punishment" ðŸ˜….
