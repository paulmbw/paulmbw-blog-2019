I have a startup idea (just like everyone else on this planet). This startup idea is related to general fitness and exercising. However, this post is not about me selling you an idea. I'm on a quest to hear your experience with working out, whether you're part of a gym, you goi for runs or jumping jacks in your back garden. I would love to hear your biggest pain points when exercising, and any thoughts you may have that could improve your experience.

Asking people to complete surveys is not easy! Espically when you are an early stage startup when Â£0. We can't promise anything in return, but we will take on board your submissions to build a product you will love.
