To act on Y Combinator's advice on [making something people want](https://blog.ycombinator.com/ycs-essential-startup-advice/), a [friend](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kalada-anga/) and I are working on a startup in the health and wellness space, specifically regarding exercising. We're on a quest to to identify people's experience when it comes to working out, whether you're part of a gym or jumping jacks in your back garden is your thing. We would love to hear your biggest pain points when it comes to exercising, and any ideas you may have that would improve your experience.

Asking people to complete surveys is not easy! Espically when you are an early stage startup with Â£0. We can't promise anything in return, but we will take on board your submissions to build a product you will both want and love. We will also keep in touch to share our progress with you so you will be a part of our journey.

Thank you!
